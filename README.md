The code is in a single python file. The only configuration necessary should be to set your interpreter to run the one file. To run the program, simply the substitute values for INFILE and OUTFILE with your desired input and output filepaths and run the file. The input file reads 3 different versions of the starting board, one with the initial values, one with the horizontal constraints, and one with the vertical constraints. Global constant variables are used for easy modification.
